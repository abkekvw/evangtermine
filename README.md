# evangtermine

This is the "evangtermine" TYPO3 extension. Extension-Key: evangtermine

It is a tool to integrate the "evangelische-termine.de" Event Database created by [Vernetzte Kirche] (http://www.vernetzte-kirche.de) into TYPO3 websites. Versions considered as the most stable can - and should - be downloaded from the TYPO3 extension repository.

Here on GitHub all development versions are hosted where it is not guaranteed that those 
will always work.

The evangtermine TYPO3 extension is developed by:

Evangelische Kirche von Westfalen
